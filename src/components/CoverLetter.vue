                <p>Dear Sir/Madam</p>
                <p>
                    This letter expresses my strong interest in the position of Web Developer at your company. With my working

                    Development).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated bachelor's degree in Information Technology at Build Bright University.
                    I have the foundation of basic computer networking, web design, and development skills like HTML5 and
                    CSS3, Tailwind

                    concepts, Laravel Framework, Livewire, Git Version Control, and LAMP (Linux, Apache, PHP, MySQL) stack.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you and discuss how my skill would meet the requirements
